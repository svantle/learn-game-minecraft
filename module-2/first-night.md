## 1. **The Break of Dawn: Immediate Tasks**

### 1.1 **Punch Trees**

* **Objective**: Gather wood.
* **Process**: Begin by punching trees to collect logs. Convert these logs into wooden planks in your inventory.

### 1.2 **Craft Basic Tools**

* **Crafting Table**: 4 wooden planks.
* **Starter Tools**: Create a wooden pickaxe, a wooden axe, and a shovel using planks and sticks.
* **Upgrade**: If you stumble upon exposed stone, craft stone tools for better efficiency.

## 2. **Daylight Exploration: Seeking Resources**

### 2.1 **Food Hunt**

* **Animals**: Hunt chickens, pigs, cows, or sheep for meat.
* **Farming**: Find seeds by breaking tall grass. They can be planted near water for wheat.
* **Apples**: Occasionally drop from decaying oak leaves.
* **Berries**: Found in Taiga biomes.

### 2.2 **Material Gathering**

* **Coal**: Look for exposed coal ore on cliff sides or dig into the ground. Essential for torches and cooking.
* **Wool**: Kill sheep or shear them. Useful for making a bed.
* **Stone**: Mine it for upgraded tools and initial construction.

## 3. **Dusk Approaches: Setting Up Shelter**

### 3.1 **Choose a Location**

* **Near Resources**: Proximity to water, coal, and food sources.
* **Visibility**: High ground or open spaces to easily locate your base after exploration.

### 3.2 **Building a Shelter**

* **Dig In**: Create a basic dugout in the side of a hill or cliff. Quick and efficient.
* **Construct**: Use wooden planks or cobblestone to make a small hut or cabin.
* **Entrance**: Secure with a door or blocks.

### 3.3 **Light It Up**

* **Torches**: Craft using sticks and coal. Place inside and outside the shelter to prevent mob spawns.

## 4. **Nightfall: Preparing for the Dark**

### 4.1 **Craft a Bed**

* **Materials**: 3 wools + 3 wooden planks.
* **Usage**: Allows you to skip the night. Place it inside your shelter and sleep.

### 4.2 **Stay Vigilant**

* **Hostile Mobs**: Zombies, skeletons, spiders, and creepers emerge at night.
* **Safety First**: If you donâ€™t have a bed, stay inside your shelter, or mine underground.

### 4.3 **Crafting & Planning**

* **Use Time**: Craft, organize inventory, and plan the next day's activities.
