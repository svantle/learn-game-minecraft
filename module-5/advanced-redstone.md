# Advanced Redstone Machinery and Automation

Once you have a grasp of basic Redstone mechanics, it's time to challenge yourself with advanced machinery and automated systems. These projects can greatly enhance efficiency and functionality in your Minecraft world.

---

### 1. **Automated Farms**

#### Auto-Harvesting Crop Farm:

* Use **observers** to detect when crops are fully grown.
* Activate pistons to break crops, making items drop.
* Collect the items using **hoppers** and direct them to a **chest**.

#### Mob Grinder:

* Design a dark chamber for mobs to spawn.
* Implement ways to funnel mobs using water currents to a killing zone.
* Use either fall damage, **lava**, or **pistons** to kill mobs and collect drops using hoppers.

### 2. **Storage and Sorting Systems**

#### Automatic Item Sorter:

* Direct items through a series of hoppers.
* Use **comparators** to check hopper contents.
* Filter specific items into designated chests.

#### Bulk Storage:

* Create large silos for items using a stack of chests and hoppers.
* Display item levels using comparators and **Redstone lamps**.

### 3. **Redstone Computers**

* By using logic gates, create basic computational systems.
* Create mechanisms like combination locks or in-game calculators.

### 4. **Transportation Networks**

#### Advanced Rail System:

* Implement **detector rails** and **TNT minecarts** to create junctions.
* Design stations with **dispensers** to provide minecarts and **cactus** to break them upon arrival.

#### Piston Bolt:

* Use alternating **pistons** and **slime blocks** to push players or entities quickly along a path.

### 5. **Advanced Traps and Defense**

#### Hidden Piston Door:

* Use a combination of **sticky pistons** and a secret activation mechanism (like a hidden **button** or **T-flip flop circuit**) to conceal an entrance.

#### Castle Gate:

* Using a vertical array of sticky pistons, create a large retractable gate.

### 6. **Automated Brewing**

* Connect several **brewing stands** with hoppers.
* Using a button selection system, automate the brewing process by funneling ingredients in the correct order.

### 7. **Redstone Contraptions**

#### Flying Machines:

* With **slime blocks**, **sticky pistons**, and **observers**, create self-propelling machines that can move in the sky.

#### Auto-Smelting Factory:

* Feed ores into furnaces using hoppers.
* Automatically distribute coal or fuel.
* Extract smelted items and direct them into storage.
