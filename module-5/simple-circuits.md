# Simple Redstone Circuits: Doors, Traps, and Transportation

Building foundational Redstone circuits can be both fun and practical. Here's a guide to some simple projects that are perfect for those just starting out with Redstone.

---

### 1. **Doors**

#### Basic Wooden Door Control:

* Use a **button** or **lever** next to a wooden door to open and close it.
* Buttons provide a pulse (temporary signal), while levers act as a toggle.

#### Iron Door Control:

* Iron doors require Redstone power to open. Place a button, lever, or pressure plate adjacent to it.
* For hidden doors, use **pistons** to move blocks and reveal an entrance.

#### Redstone-Powered Double Doors:

* For double doors to open simultaneously, ensure that the Redstone wiring connects to both doors properly.

### 2. **Traps**

#### Pitfall Trap:

* Dig a deep pit and cover it with a thin layer of blocks.
* Place **wooden pressure plates** on the blocks.
* When a player or mob steps on the plate, use **pistons** to retract the blocks, causing the entity to fall into the pit.

#### Arrow Dispenser Trap:

* Place a **dispenser** filled with arrows.
* Connect it to a **pressure plate** or **tripwire hook** using Redstone.
* When triggered, the dispenser shoots arrows.

#### Lava Door Trap:

* Construct a regular-looking doorway but hide **pistons** above and below.
* When the unsuspecting player enters, use a pressure plate or tripwire to activate the pistons, which then push the player into a hidden lava pit.

### 3. **Transportation**

#### Simple Rail Station:

* Use **powered rails** to accelerate minecarts.
* Place a button next to the rail to power it, launching the cart when pressed.
* To stop the cart at the next station, use a combination of **detector rails** and **regular rails**.

#### Boat Launcher:

* Construct a small water canal ending with a **piston**.
* Place a **button** next to the piston.
* When a boat is in the canal and the button is pressed, the piston extends, launching the boat at high speed.

#### Elevator:

* Using alternating **pistons** and **blocks**, create a platform that moves upwards.
* Connect the pistons to a circuit where they activate sequentially, pushing the player upwards in stages.
