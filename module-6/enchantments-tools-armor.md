# Basic and Advanced Enchantments for Tools and Armor

Enchanting your tools and armor not only extends their durability but also introduces specialized functionalities. Here's a curated list of both basic and advanced enchantments for your gear:

---

### **1. Basic Enchantments**

#### **Tools (Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, and Hoe)**

* **Efficiency** (I-V): Increases the speed of which blocks are mined or dug.
* **Unbreaking** (I-III): Gives a chance that using the item won't decrease durability.

#### **Armor (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Boots)**

* **Protection** (I-IV): Reduces most damage types.
* **Unbreaking** (I-III): As with tools, gives a chance the item won't suffer durability loss.

#### **Sword**

* **Sharpness** (I-V): Increases melee damage.
* **Unbreaking** (I-III): As above, reduces chances of durability loss.

### **2. Advanced Enchantments**

#### **Tools**

* **Fortune** (I-III): Increases drop rates. For example, a diamond ore block might drop more than one diamond.
* **Silk Touch**: Allows blocks to be harvested in their original state, e.g., diamond ore instead of diamond.
* **Mending**: Uses experience orbs to mend the tool, extending its lifespan.

#### **Armor**

* **Fire Protection** (I-IV): Reduces damage from fire and lava.
* **Feather Falling** (I-IV): Reduces fall damage (for boots).
* **Respiration** (I-III): Extends breathing time underwater (for helmet).
* **Depth Strider** (I-III): Increases underwater movement speed (for boots).
* **Thorns** (I-III): Causes damage to attackers.
* **Mending**: As with tools, uses experience to mend armor pieces.

#### **Sword**

* **Looting** (I-III): Increases drop rates from mobs.
* **Fire Aspect** (I-II): Sets targets on fire.
* **Knockback** (I-II): Pushes targets back.
* **Mending**: Uses experience orbs to mend the sword.

### **3. Special Mentions**

* **Frost Walker** (I-II) (Boots): Turns water beneath the player into frosted ice.
* **Curse of Vanishing**: Item disappears upon death. Not necessarily desirable, but it's an enchantment to be aware of.
* **Curse of Binding**: Once equipped, the item can't be removed until it breaks or the player dies.
