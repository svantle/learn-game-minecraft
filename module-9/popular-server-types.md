# Exploring Popular Server Types

---

## **Mini-Games Servers**

Mini-games servers are akin to virtual amusement parks, providing players with a collection of varied game modes and challenges.

* **Skywars**: Players spawn on floating islands and must bridge to other islands to loot and combat others. The last player or team standing wins.

* **Bed Wars**: Players need to protect their bed while trying to destroy others'. Once your bed is destroyed, you can't respawn.

* **Hunger Games (Survival Games)**: Players are thrown into an arena, loot chests for gear, and fight to be the last player standing.

* **Parkour**: Jumping puzzles that challenge players' agility and dexterity.

* **Maze Runner**: Players are trapped in a massive maze, filled with challenges and monsters.

## **Role-Playing Servers (RPG)**

Role-playing servers allow players to assume roles in various scenarios and live out stories within the game.

* **Medieval Kingdoms**: Players join houses, build castles, and engage in medieval-themed events and wars.

* **City Life**: Simulates life in a bustling city with jobs, money, and property.

* **Factions**: Players create and join factions, claiming land, and engaging in politics and wars against other factions.

* **Magic & Custom Enchants**: Servers that introduce magic spells, wands, and enchanted items, offering an RPG experience with unique combat and exploration dynamics.

## **Survival Servers**

A more traditional Minecraft experience, these servers focus on the core aspects of the game, often with added communal elements.

* **Vanilla Survival**: These servers offer the basic survival experience, often with minimal plugins or modifications.

* **Towny**: Players create towns, invite residents, and form nations. This type has an emphasis on community, with a mix of survival and role-playing elements.

* **Economy Survival**: These servers have a virtual economy where players can earn money through jobs, trade, or selling items, which can then be spent in player-created shops.

* **Hardcore Survival**: Once you die, you're either banned for a specific time or permanently, making survival stakes extremely high.
